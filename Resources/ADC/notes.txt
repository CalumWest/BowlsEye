A typical application of the ADC122S101 is shown in Figure 52. Power is provided, in this example, by the
LP2950 low-dropout voltage regulator, available in a variety of fixed and adjustable output voltages. The power
supply pin is bypassed with a capacitor network located close to the ADC122S101. Because the reference for
the ADC122S101 is the supply voltage, any noise on the supply will degrade device noise performance. To keep
noise off the supply, use a dedicated linear regulator for this device, or provide sufficient decoupling from other
circuitry to keep noise off the ADC122S101 supply pin. Because of the ADC122S101's low power requirements,
it is also possible to use a precision reference as a power supply to maximize performance. The four-wire
interface is shown connected to a microprocessor or DSP
