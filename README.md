# Problem
----------

Assistive technology is used throughout many sports to aid referees to determine the correct decision, or allow competetors to appeal against said decisions.  However, in the sport of lawn bowls, there is still a large factor of human error that can occur when measuring the distance between the jack and the bowls when the game is close.  As this is currently done with standard measurment techniques, any misreading of this distance by the referee will determine the wrong outcome of the game.  Therefore, this project aims to remove the possibility of human error in these measurements by designing a real time embedded system that can perform these measurments more accurately than a human.
